# AdventOfCode2017

### What It Is
I heard about Advent of Code from a professor I was taking a class from. Basically,
it's a set of puzzles you can use your computer to solve. It just describes the problem
and gives you a (user-specific) input, and asks for the solution, so you can use any 
language to solve it. 

### What I did
I decided to do the Advent of Code in Perl, for the simple reason that I don't (didn't) know Perl.
This is going to be a learning process, for sure. 
I'm learning mostly from the official perldocs, along with a liberal helping of Google and StackOverflow,
the old standbys.
